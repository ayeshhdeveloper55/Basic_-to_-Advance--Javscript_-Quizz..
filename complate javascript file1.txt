1.

Q: Synchronous code execution ka matlab kya hai?
A: Code ek ek line sequence me execute hota hai aur agla instruction wait karta hai pichle ke complete hone ka.

2.

Q: Asynchronous execution ka fayda kya hai?
A: Ye agle instructions ko turant execute karne deta hai bina UI block kiye.

3.

Q: Callback function kya hai?
A: Ek function jo doosre function ko argument ke taur pe pass hota hai.

4.

Q: Callback hell ko aur kis naam se jaana jata hai?
A: Pyramid of Doom.

5.

Q: Callback hell kyun problem hota hai?
A: Code nested ho jata hai, samajhna aur manage karna mushkil ho jata hai.

6.

Q: Promise ka use kis problem ko solve karta hai?
A: Callback hell.

7.

Q: Ek Promise object ke teen possible states kya hote hain?
A: Pending, Resolved (Fulfilled), Rejected.

8.

Q: Agar promise resolve ho jaye to result kahan aata hai?
A: Resolve me value return hoti hai (fulfilled state).

9.

Q: Agar promise reject ho jaye to result kahan aata hai?
A: Reject me error object return hota hai.

10.

Q: Promise banane ka syntax kya hai?
A:

let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... });

11.

Q: Promise ka result access karne ke liye kaun se methods use hote hain?
A: .then() aur .catch().

12.

Q: .then() ka use kis liye hota hai?
A: Promise ke resolved value ko handle karne ke liye.

13.

Q: .catch() ka use kis liye hota hai?
A: Promise ke rejected value (error) ko handle karne ke liye.

14.

Q: Async function hamesha kya return karta hai?
A: Promise.

15.

Q: Await ka kaam kya hai?
A: Ek async function ke andar execution ko pause karta hai jab tak promise settle na ho jaye.

16.

Q: Kya await async function ke bahar use kar sakte hain?
A: Nahi, sirf async function ke andar hi use hota hai.

17.

Q: Async/Await ka main advantage promises ke upar kya hai?
A: Code simple aur readable lagta hai (synchronous style).

18.

Q: Ek async function ka example likho.
A:

async function myFunc() {
  return "Hello";
}

19.

Q: IIFE ka full form kya hai?
A: Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

20.

Q: IIFE ka use kyun hota hai?
A: Function ko turant execute karne aur variables ko private scope me rakhne ke liye.

21.

Q: IIFE ka syntax kya hai?
A:

(function() {
  console.log("Hello");
})();

22.

Q: Agar ek function async hai to uska return value promise na ho to bhi kya milega?
A: Hamesha ek resolved promise return karega.

23.

Q: Ek resolved promise ka default state aur result kya hota hai?
A: Fulfilled state aur value return hoti hai.

24.

Q: Agar promise reject ho jaye aur uska .catch() na likhen to kya hoga?
A: Unhandled Promise Rejection error aayega.

25.

Q: Callback hell, Promises, aur Async/Await ka relation short me batao.
A: Callback hell → Promises (solution) → Async/Await (aur easy solution).
